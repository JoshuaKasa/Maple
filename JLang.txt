0) General informations:

JoshLang is a very simple low level programming language which does not have many functionalities yet. You have to write everything line by line without needing to worry about the one's before.

1) Variable initilization:

In JoshLang variable initialization works with 3 operators:
- dec: this keyword is used to initialize a variable, after this should be the actual initialization;
- ch/uch: ch and uch stand for changable and unchanchable, this are put after dec to declare if the variable can be changed or only read;
- type: the type of the variable, can be: num (for both ints and floats), bul (for booleans), aph (for alphanumerical (strings))
- variable name: the variable name (no special characters)
- value: the value of the variable

2) Changing variables:

For changing variables you just use the name of the variable, followed by the value (that must be of the initial type)

3) General functions:

JoshLang has a bit of already done functions, which are:
- out variable name : this can only print from a variable
- run number of times: this should be put at the start of the program for saying how many times it should be run

4) For loops:

For loops are a bit different in JoshLang, they are made with the "around" keyword, followed by the variable used to keep track of the loop and the number of times to run the loop. For ending the "around" loop use the "roll" keyword:

around variable number_of_times
    [code]
roll

5) "back" keyword:

The "back" keyword is used to go backup a variable in a certain state, used with the "load" keyword for saving and loading the state of a variable.

END) Sample program:

run 5

dec uch aph hello "hello world!"
dec uch num number 10

out hello
out num

Output: hello world! 10
